## Boston Housing PySpark Analysis
This repository contains the code and report for a detailed analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset as part of an assignment. The analysis was performed using PySpark in a Jupyter notebook, and the findings are summarized in a PDF report.

# Problem Statement
The task was to analyze the Boston Housing dataset by categorizing housing records into bins based on the average number of rooms (“RM”) and calculating statistics for each bin.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following attributes:

-RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
-MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes (the target attribute).
-Additional attributes such as “AGE” (proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940), “TAX” (property tax rate), and more.

# Tasks
1. Data Preparation: Obtain the complete Boston Housing dataset and preprocess the data as needed, including cleaning and handling any missing values.
2. Coding: Develop PySpark Code.
3. Results and Analysis: Examine the output of your output, which should contain statistics for each bin. Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts and more) to represent the calculated statistics. Interpret the results and provide insights about the relationship between the number of rooms (“RM”) and the median value (“MEDV”) of homes in different bins.
